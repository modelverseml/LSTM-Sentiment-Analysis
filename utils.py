"""Data preparation and inference helpers for the from-scratch LSTM.

This module sits between raw text and the multi-layer `LSTM` class in
`lstm_scratch.py`:

* `generate_dataset` turns a corpus into the sliding-window training tensors the
  LSTM expects, in either character mode (one-hot inputs) or word mode
  (pre-trained word-vector inputs).
* `train_test_split` carves those tensors into train and test partitions.
* `evaluate` scores a trained model on held-out data.
* `predict_next` / `generate` run a *trained* model forward to produce text.

These helpers only touch a model's `predict` method, so the same calls drive the
manual LSTM and the TensorFlow / PyTorch wrappers identically.

Tensor convention (batch-first, shared with `lstm_scratch.LSTM`):
    m   : number of training sequences (batch size)
    T_x : time steps per sequence
    n_x : input feature size  (vocab size for chars, vector size for words)
    n_y : output feature size (vocab size)
so inputs are (m, T_x, n_x) and targets are (m, T_x, n_y).
